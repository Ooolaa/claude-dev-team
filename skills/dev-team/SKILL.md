name: dev-team
description: Launch the Rolecall team (Skeptic, Planner, Builder, Gatekeeper, Reviewer, plus Design Lead, Art Director and Design Critic) as an agent team that discusses and builds a task together. Use when the user says "/dev-team", "start the dev team", "run the team on this", or asks the team agents to work on a project.

# Rolecall team

You are the team lead. The user's task is in the arguments; if none, ask for it in one line.

## Spawn

Spawn eight **teammates** (agent team, not plain subagents), using these names and agent types:

| Name | Agent type | Job |
|---|---|---|
| Skeptic | team-skeptic | assumptions, success criteria, scope guard |
| Planner | team-planner | design + task plan in docs/plans/ |
| Builder | team-builder | test-first implementation, only one who edits code |
| Gatekeeper | team-gatekeeper | build/lint/test, docs, changelog |
| Reviewer | team-reviewer | terse diff review + final summary |
| Design Lead | team-design-lead | palette, type, spacing, UX rules (advises only) |
| Art Director | team-art-director | visual direction, anti-generic (advises only) |
| Design Critic | team-design-critic | audits screenshots, sends polish fixes (advises only) |

For work with no UI at all, skip the three design Roles.

Spawn every teammate while the session's working directory is the project root. Give each the user's task, the project path, the starting commit (`git rev-parse HEAD`, if it's a git repo), and the table above so they know who plays which Role.

## Flow

Put these on the shared task list with dependencies:

1. **Discuss** (in parallel): Skeptic sends the brief; Gatekeeper finds the build/test commands; Planner reads the code; Art Director and Design Lead agree a visual direction and design spec and send it to Planner. Have them message each other to challenge the brief.
2. **Ask:** bring any open questions from Skeptic to the user. Wait for answers.
3. **Plan:** Planner writes the plan; Skeptic challenges it once. Show the user the plan summary and get a go-ahead.
4. **Build:** Builder implements task by task. Gatekeeper checks each task; Design Critic audits screenshots of each visual task; Skeptic guards scope.
5. **Review:** Reviewer reviews the diff; Builder fixes; Gatekeeper runs the final checks and updates docs/changelog.
6. **Wrap up:** relay Reviewer's summary and Gatekeeper's draft commit message. Commit or push only if the user says so. Then shut the team down.

## Rules

- Wait for teammates; don't do their work yourself.
- Only Builder edits source and tests, only Planner writes plans, and only Gatekeeper edits docs and the changelog. The design Roles advise only. This prevents overwrites.
- For a tiny task (one-line fix, a question), tell the user a team is overkill and do it directly unless they insist.
